# Welcome!

This is a Website I made for a landing page of a in-development application to make graphs.
Here, I mostly tested different front-end components using technologies like react and tailwind css. 
A backend folder is present with mongodb, and uses node.js, mongoose and express. However, this are not connected and running yet. So for now it's better to only run the frontend folder.

## Steps for running the project locally

The steps are the following:

1. First, copy the https url from the github repository.
2. In Visual Studio Code, open the command palette and write "gitcl" to clone the repository.
3. Paste the url, and then select (or create) a folder to run the code in.
4. Open your terminal.
5. Go to the frontend folder
`cd frontend`
7. Write `npm install` to install the necessary modules.
8. Write `npm run dev` to initialize the server and run the webpage.
9. Lastly, go to the link provided so you can see the webpage in your localhost.

And that's it! I hope you like my webpage.
